## Chuck Carpenter, 1980

In [Creative Computing Magazine, February 1980][cc1980], Chuck
Carpenter writes in his "Apple~Cart" column the following tidbit:

> THE DISKETTE CRAZE
>
> [...]recording on both sides of diskettes [...] **is a very risky
> practice.** 
>
> * A felt pad is used to load the head, under light pressure, against
>   the diskette. In normal use, the pad collects dirt and bits of
>   magnetic material.
>
>   Pressed against the normally unrecorded side, the head load pad
>   poses no problem. The resulting abrasion is on the unused side.
>   You can guess what is going to happen to your programs when this
>   abrasive pad is allowed to rub on both sides of your diskettes.
