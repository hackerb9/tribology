# The Trouble With (amateur) Tribology

This repository is for investigating how the parts in the Drive II for
the Apple II computer wear down. (The study of wear is called
"tribology"). In particular, this was motivated by attempting to find
a suitable felt replacement for the head pressure pad that would not
mar the surface.

In order to test a component, use the TRIBOLOGY TRIAL program which
prompts for a track to move the head to and then cycles around on it
forever, perhaps scraping off the magnetic material and etching a ring
into the diskette. 

The program attempts to calculate elapsed wall time but it is not very
accurate, so it's better to use an external clock when possible. 

An ideal test will run for 7 days straight.
